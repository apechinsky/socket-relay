= Socket controller

Here's the corrected version of the text:

The socket controller detects a load by measuring AC current. When a load is detected, the controller waits for some time (1.5 hours) and then turns off the load for a short period of time (a few seconds) before turning it on again.

This feature is useful for people who forget to turn off their TVs.

    When a person turns on the TV,
    the TV works for 1.5 hours,
    and then the controller turns it off for 4 seconds by switching the relay off and on.

Now, the TV is in standby mode and ready to be turned on with the remote control.
